//In Java, a legal identifier is a name used to identify a variable, method, class, or any other programming element. Identifiers are case-sensitive and must adhere to the following rules:
//
//- An identifier must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
//- After the first character, an identifier can contain any combination of letters, digits (0-9), underscores, or dollar signs.
//- Identifiers cannot be a keyword or reserved word in Java.
//- Identifiers can be of any length.
//Here are some examples of legal identifiers in Java:
	
public class LegarVars {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	}

}
