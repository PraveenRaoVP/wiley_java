package Exceptions;

//In Java, it's possible to handle an entire class hierarchy of exceptions 
	//using a single catch block. This can be useful when you want to handle 
	//all exceptions in a particular hierarchy in the same way, 
	//without having to write separate catch blocks for each exception class.
//
//To handle an entire class hierarchy of exceptions, 
	//you can catch the superclass of the exception hierarchy, 
	//rather than catching each individual exception class

public class EntireClass {
	try {
		  // some code that might throw an exception
		} catch (IOException e) {
		  // handle IOException
		} catch (SQLException e) {
		  // handle SQLException
		} catch (Exception e) {
		  // handle any other exception in the hierarchy
		}
}
