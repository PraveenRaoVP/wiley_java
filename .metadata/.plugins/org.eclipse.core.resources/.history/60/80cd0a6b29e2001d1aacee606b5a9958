		// Arithmetic operators: 
		// These operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numeric data types, including 
//		addition (+), 
//		subtraction (-), 
//		multiplication (*), 
//		division (/), and 
//		modulus (%). For example:
		int x = 10;
		int y = 5;
		int sum = x + y; // sum is 15
		int diff = x - y; // diff is 5
		int product = x * y; // product is 50
		int quotient = x / y; // quotient is 2
		int remainder = x % y; // remainder is 0
		
		//Relational operators: These operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean value (true or false), including less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or equal to (>=), equal to (==), and not equal to (!=). For example:
		int x = 10;
		int y = 5;
		boolean isGreaterThan = x > y; // true
		boolean isEqualTo = x == y; // false
		boolean isLessThanOrEqualTo = x <= y; // false
